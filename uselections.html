		<h1>Joe Biden appoints Kamala Devi Harris as Vice-Presidential Candidate</h1>
		<p style="text-align:left">2020 has been an eventful year. An important upcoming event which hs the world's eyes on it is the U.S.presednetial elections in November in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>-the current U.S. president - from the Republican party and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a>-once vice-president under Barack Obama- from the Democrats are going to contest for the president position of America.</p>

		<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris" target="_blank">Kamala Devi Harris</a> has been chosen as the face of Republican party's vice-president. well, me being an Indian felt really good listening this at firs, thinking that this is a good initiative towards strengthning of U.S.-Indian ties.<br>
			Kamala Harris is of Indian-American origin. Her mother being an Indian who came to America from Tamil Nadu and maaried an American man.<br>
			From Trump side Mike Pence-the current vice-president will continue to contest for the same position.

		<h3>The politics....</h3>
		<p>Appointing a <em>person of color</em> to contrest for vice-presidential position is a good step as far as vote-bank is considered. One of the major reason for Clinton's defeat was lack of support from Afro-Americans.
		Afro-Americans constitute about 13.4% of the voting public in U.S.-5% are Indian.
		<br>If biden wins, Kamala will be the first ever person of color to become U.S vice-president. For Trump her appointment is for sure unpleasant.

		<h3>Kamala Harris Role</h3>
		<p>
			Not just for vote bank, Kamala Harris will be a response for Joe Biden's all those doubts on Biden's cognitive abilities.She might just work the was<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney" target="_blank"> Dick Cheney</a>did. 
			<br>Dick Cheney was the vice-president under George Bush. Bush not being very proactive, Dick Cheney represnted his interests and is regarded as the <em>The Strongest Vice-President</em>
			<br>Trump,Obama are proactive. But as far as Biden is considered many people doubt his cognitive abilites due to his age. So here Kamala can appear as a strong represenative in the front face.

		<h3>India and U.S.</h3>
		<p>I think it was premature of me any my Indian fellows to celebrate this decision.
			Kamala is an Indian-American but what about here interest??
			Well let me site some incidents of pasts:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>
				Kamal opposed the abrogation of Article 370 by Indian government and said that Kashmiris need not think that they were alone. he assured them that they were with here regarding this issue.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				The CAA decision was opposed by 5 senators of the Republic Party. Kamala was one of them.One of the senators <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramila_Jayapal" target="_blank">Pramila Jayapal</a></strong> even suggested to pass a resolution to this act.
				This was responded by foreign misister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyam_Jaishankar" target="_blank">S.Jaishankar</a> when he decided not to attend meeting of which Jayapal was a part of.Kamala Harris criticized this decision of our MFA.
			</p></li>

			<li><p>Never have she ever commented on terrorism supported by Pakistan and force conversions of Indians in Pakistan</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>My Views..</h3>
		<p>Well I think that Kamala Harris was born in America. She has Indian DNA, that does not make her love India. This is only done for appeasment of Afro-Americans.Her views on India clearly depicts how strict she is when it comes to India.
		<br>So I feel that Indians in America should think befor voting for her for she is just using her background for vgathering votes</p>
