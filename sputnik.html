	<h1>Russia Develops First Covid-19 Vaccine</h1>
	<p>Scientists across whole are trying hard to develop the coronavirus vaccine, governments investing billions on it.
	<br>And now the news comes that Russian institute GAMALAYA INSTITUTE has developed world's first civilian covid-19 vaccine.This was a surprised to thre world since the vaccine was approved for commomn people of Russia by the government only after less number of testing.
	</p>

	<h2>Will the world accept this vaccine?</h2>
	<p>
		It is said that enough human trials are not done on this vaccine.There are claims that Russian government has approved this vaccine after Phase-2 trials only. So WHO will be doing its investigation to approve the distribution of this vaccine worldwide.<br>Normally a vaccine cannot be developed at such fast pace. It needs to go through number of testing phases:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Laboratory Trials</li>
			<li>Animal Trials</li>
			<li>Phase-1 trials on human beings(about40-100)</li>
			<li>Phase-2 trials on human beings(about-1000)</li>
			<li>Phase-3 trials on human beings(about-50,000)</li>
			<li>Approval from national and international bodies</li>
			<li>Manufacturing</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		Russia is not the first country to inject covid-19 vaccine. China had already started giving doses of its vaccine, but not on civilians , only on military commandos.Russia here is the first country which will give doses of vaccine to its civilians by January 2021.
		<br>Many countries have already shown their interest in manufacturing of this vaccine including India.
		If this vaccine is approved by WHO then India will for sure manufacture this vaccine but might not publicise it to every citizen.India will more preferrably wait for the vaccine developed by Oxford University or by Pune-based researchg centre.
	</p>

		<h2>What does Russia has to say about this</h2>
		<h4>Putin's daughter has been injected with this vaccine</h4>
		<p>
			Well,Russia justifies the development of this vaccine in unexpected time period by saying that this was the same vaccine that was being developed during the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) virus.So much of testing was not required.This vaccine contains dead coronavirus which in no way can be hazardous.
		</p>

		<h5>My views:</h5>
		<p>Well, it is satisfying that some country has come up with its vaccine.Putin giving her own daughter this vaccine is a good sign for people.Well,we must wait for WHO's statement on this vaacine and also on the development of Oxford's vaccine which is in its Phase-3 trials.2020 has already given us so many surprises,lets hope for the best.</p>
